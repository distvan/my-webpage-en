<p>Since February 1st, 2022, I’ve been swimming three to four times a week. I also joined the local triathlon club. Running, swimming, and cycling have become my lifestyle, and I regularly participate in sprint-distance competitions.
In 2023, I received “Most Motivated” recognition from the club for my dedication.
I draw a lot of inspiration from my teammates—I’m truly grateful to them all. And of course, the journey continues!</p>]]></content><author><name>Istvan Dobrentei</name></author><category term="triatlon" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the COVID period, a new swimming pool was built in my city.

<p>Running with István made the experience even more meaningful. It wasn’t just a run — it became a journey through time, enriched by the personal connection and his deep knowledge of the area.</p>

<p>Many thanks to István for the guidance.

I didn’t have a plan — I just wanted to connect with nature and clear my mind.</p>

<p>Following my feet and instincts, I eventually found myself in a small town called Isaszeg. I ran a bit further around the outskirts and stumbled upon a memorial stone at the edge of the city, in a place called Szentgyörgypuszta. I later learned that this was a historic battlefield, where soldiers once fought for Hungary’s independence.</p>

<p>When I got home, I looked it up and found this animated video about the battle — it really moved me. You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3p1Eddh2r0">here</a></p>

<p>Inspired by the experience, I decided to return a year later to honor the memory of the battle with an “anniversary run” on April 6th — the day of the original event.</p>

<p>So, on April 6th, 2014, at 9 a.m., I began my commemorative run. The route took me along what’s known as the “tank road,” named after the nearby military facility where vehicles are repaired and tested. On the right side, there’s an arboretum, and a path that leads into the forest. Accompanied by the peaceful sound of a church bell in the distance, I eventually reached the center of Isaszeg.</p>

<p>I continued running through a street symbolically named Csata (Battle Street). At the end of the street, I climbed a hill where a monument stands — a powerful tribute to the events of 1849. From the top, you can look out over the area and, with a bit of imagination, place yourself in the middle of that historic battle.</p>

<p>Each year, the town hosts a battle reenactment and a memorial ceremony to honor those who fought there. It adds even more depth to the visit — whether you’re running, walking, or just exploring.</p>

<p>That day, I ran for 3.5 hours and covered 24 kilometers. It was a meaningful, powerful experience, and I plan to return next year to run again — this time during the battle reenactment event.</p>

On May 31st, 2013, we traveled to the race starting point in three vehicles.</p>

<p>The weather was quite unpredictable at that time. On the day of the race, it rained, and I got soaked — but shortly afterward, the sun came out and shone warmly. A good sign to start with!</p>

<p>After checking into our apartments, we kicked off the pasta party and finalized a well-detailed plan for the next day. One person would run while another cycled beside them, then they would switch at designated exchange points.</p>

<p>A big thanks to the Why Not! agency for providing us with a brand-new bicycle and specially designed t-shirts for the event.</p>

<p>We ran through day and night, in sunshine and thunderstorms, switching at 31 points along the way. Our total time was 20 hours and 16 minutes.</p>

<p>It was both a great challenge and an amazing display of teamwork. Running 212 kilometers without rest is almost impossible for an “ordinary” person — but with a strong team, anything is possible.</p>

<p>It was a life-changing experience, and I’m truly grateful to everyone who was part of the team and gave their very best.</p>

<p>“A marathon is not a battle between nations, races, or beliefs. It is a celebration of humanity - thousands of hearts beating together in pursuit of a personal victory. On the course, we are not divided by gender, color, or creed, but united by the road and the will to endure.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Istvan Dobrentei</name></author><category term="running" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I ran the first marathon of my life on October 7th, 2012, in Budapest.
